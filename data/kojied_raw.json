I moved to the Bay Area because I wanted to live in a place that had good career opportunity, diversity, weather, and work-life balance. \nI’ve always been search for an “ideal home”, and have traveled to London, Paris, Berlin, Zurich, Amsterdam, Rome, Madrid, Barcelona, Zagreb, Accra, Capetown, NYC, LA, Chicago, Toronto, Singapore, Taipei, Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen. Oh yeah and bunch of places in japan. \nThe truth is, there’s no place that’s going to “call out to you”. Maybe there is, but it may take your entire life to find it, or you may never find it. \nTrying to be a “maximizer” will only get you so far in life. It’s important to sometimes be a “satisfier” and have some requirements, and stay wherever that meets what you’re looking for. (Book “paradox of choice”)\n\nThe faster you commit to a place or community, the faster you find a “home” imo.\nI don’t regret traveling around though. A lot of it was business so I was able to do it as work, as well as meet a lot of locals through my company’s regional offices.\nIt’s good to expand your horizon, but also important to find a time to reach a conclusion and commit.",

    "body": "Welcome to the 🐻side. Hope you don’t get laid off, but happy to provide my insight. I’m not a professional trader but have made 300% gains this past month. Here’s what I’m doing:\n\nNow that even Mckinsey is saying economic recovery will take until Q4, a lot of put options are starting to get expensive. It’s what people would call it “priced in”, since it’s no secret we’ll likely see a recession. With that being said I’ll still buy some puts.\nI’d buy put options on days when the market is making a rebound. Considering we went down like crazy today, I foresee a temporary bounce back tomorrow. I bought some apple, cvs, Walmart stocks today, and will sell them tomorrow hopefully around +4%. \nWith that money, I intend to buy some call options. Which ones? Not entirely sure but thinking of following.\nSPY is a safe bet. If the economy goes down long term, so will SPY put options.\nAvoid airlines, as there’s been conversations of bail outs. \nIf MGM or Wynn recovers a lot tomorrow (8%+) I’ll buy mid term (3 month) puts there.\nDon’t know enough about oil so won’t gamble there\nThink I missed the boat on VIX so not touching that too.\n\nUntil when will I hold them? Probably will sell 1/2 in 2 weeks, the rest in 4 weeks. I know holding puts overnight or over weekends are a bad idea normally, but now that puts are so high in demand, I feel like holding them for a longer period is better than keeping on buying shorter puts. Even considering the value depreciation as it get closed to expiry date. (Not an expert but has worked for me so far).\nWhy 2 weeks and 4 weeks? I want to play it safe. China has recovered from covid19 but people aren’t fully back to work yet. I have friends on the ground who own manufacturing companies and that’s their information. So earliest China is back full capacity is 2 weeks from now. Should be back to capacity in 4 weeks. \nWill the market keep on going down until end of Q3? Possibly. But I’ve made enough money and I don’t see a reason to take more risks. DM me if you want to know what I actually did, since the situation constantly changes.",

This got me thinking, is there a way to develop a mental model on what we buy or don't buy?\n\nI feel that most people decide what to buy based on past experiences, gut feeling, or the mood of that day. But is there a way to better understand what we get our \"gratification\" from, and track this?\n\nMy initial idea was an app that would enable users to track the \"gratification\" they receive from their purchases. If you regret what you bought, you can record a decline in the gratification, or if you found the purchase better than you expected, you can record an increase.\n\nOf course, this would not necessarily apply to all purchases. Some things (rent, insurance, etc.) do not yield any gratification scores, but many purchases (clothes, going out, etc.) could.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould love to hear how you make your purchase decisions, and if there's a mental model you follow!\n\n(photo is a mockup of the idea I'm working on)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w7dzy8gi0jib1.png?width=616&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=803a36d08e4dce445fef0c9b07bbf9a3a1ab97a4",

The only common rule of thumb is relativity amongst your other purchases.\n\n\"How do I compare a bar of chocolate to a denim jacket? Would a hundred chocolate bars bring more gratification for me compared to one jacket?\"\n\nThe problem of dividing consumption to purely physical and emotional need is that most purchases are not purely one or another. Chocolate has calories which satisfies your physical needs, but it also satisfies your emotional ones. Denim jackets keep you warm which satisfies a physical need, but could be a fashion statement as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOppenheimer was definitely a blast btw, worth watching on the big screen.",

One of the reasons I wanted to build this app is because I used to treat purchasing as retail therapy as well, and one day I bought one too many things I wasn't going to use, and was like 'hol up.\n\nHow would you like to track the value you get from your purchases, and do you think this would help you make better purchase decisions in the future?",

Hearing you say that you can't believe this doesn't exist yet is the best compliment I can receive. \n\nIt definitely seems like this app would work in tandem with a budgeting app. \n\nADHD is real, and it's only getting more real with people's attention span shortening (short form video content, etc.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow do you currently do the budgeting, list making, reviews? What kind of interface do you think you would find valuable?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(back to the other points you mentioned)\n\nAnother reason I wanted to build this app is because we're in a crazy economic period where most people in America are starting to feel the pressure. Groceries are expensive, rent is up, but our wages just haven't increased at the same pace. \n\nIf you ask me, the way middle class Americans have lived their lives for the past century is an outlier in the history of humankind. For most of history, majority of the world lived \"paycheck-to-paycheck\", even if their \"paychecks\" came in the form of crop harvest. \n\nBut it doesn't have to be, in this day and age! We can find ways to find fulfillment without having to get the newest gadgets, fashion items, or travel to Greece every summer.",

Sure it has developed new investing policies and has made some impact from the shareholder side, but as someone who's worked in environmental consulting, I felt that we needed a more direct way of getting ESG ratings into the mass conscience.\n\n**Do you think individuals should be aware of our own ESG rating?**\n\nI feel that companies would take ESG ratings  seriously if consumers changed their purchase behaviors based on the score.\n\nThe current method of consumer activism has yielded lackluster results. This is because once the news dies down, consumers forget about the scandal and go back to normal purchasing behavior. In addition, companies aren't really incentivized to make changes, since consumers hear about the scandal, but rarely stay informed about what was done about it.\n\nThe first step towards voting with our dollars is to be aware of our current ESG impact. This can be approximated through the ESG score of the companies you are purchasing goods/services from, multiplied by the dollar amount of your purchase. [Sustainalytics](https://www.sustainalytics.com/) has a comprehensive ESG rating for most public companies. For purchases from businesses that are private (and doesn't have any ESG rating), we can approximate from comparable public companies, or use other indicators (BCorp, Fair Trade, etc.)\n\nPlease let me know what you think!\n\nIndividual ESG scores could elevate sustainable conscience to another level, which would lead to climate activism on a larger scale.",

Which is why the west, led by the US, has been trying to cause instability, and destroy historical artifacts. That way, the true history of how the WG came to be won’t come into light. Like, archaeology is basically using artifacts discovered and interpreting it a certain way. The whole concept is something that mostly grew into a concept in the UK around 1824. 1824 is the year the Oxford English Dictionary defined \"archaeology\" a word.\n\n(Btw our generation will be remembered for our new additions which include anti-work, curry laksa, diet-busting, final frontier, fugazi, gajillion, skellington, straight-talking, stonkingly, voguing,etc.)\n\nBack to the main topic, what I’m saying is that it’s pretty easy for the “1%” to control the “story of our world” through archeologists and historians. These have traditionally been an activity for the rich and remains that way. Like, who tries to become a historian unless they have trust funds?\n\nSo yeah, maybe the history we are told on a daily basis is pretty different from reality, and Oda is trying to tell us this message.\n\nWhat are pacifistas? They're our modern comparable to AI. They will be the ultimate, infinite, obedient, power between the celestial dragons (also known as the 1%) and us normal humans.\n\nSo who is our Nika?

With the recent controversy around Palworld, they're looking for the next \"Pokemon Go\" that would propel their franchise to the next level.\n\nBeing Japanese, I happen to know a few key decision makers both in the Pokemon Company as well as Niantic. Alot of the in-game designs are transferrable, and I believe it's a matter of time until Niantic's Lightship ARDK will work on AVP.\n\n*What should I tell them? Lmk if you have thoughts or useful links/videos I should forward to them.*\n\nI'm confident that this will eventually become a thing, but the faster they ship the more AVP adoption we'll see.\n\n[personal info redacted for obvious reasons](https://preview.redd.it/be7qbqfg5qgc1.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21fec81575a29fa53fc01639e368980dc4c5ac6f)",

If you're putting up Japanese artwork as art and is respecting it, I doubt any Japanese person will take offense. But making some cheap piece of clothing and branding it as \"kimono\" since it will sell better is disrespectful in my eyes.\n\nI think the keyword here is \"authenticity\" and \"respect\". As long as one adopts a culture with these in mind, there is nothing wrong with it. But it's ultimately up to those who belong in the original culture to decide if these standards are being met. Obviously there is no \"singular hive mind of Japanese consciousness\", and the answer will depend from person to person. \n\nAs Japan becomes more racially/culturally diverse (albeit slower than most other nations), these definitions will shift. A Ukrainian born woman (ethnically entirely white European) just became Ms. Japan, which led to alot of backlash. Personally I think this is a welcoming change as Japan embraces diversity, especially as she is much more culturally Japanese than most ethnically Japanese people. I feel Japan should redefine what it means to be Japanese, and cultural symbols like her or Osaka Naomi, Rui Hachimura, are pushing the envelope in a positive way.\n\n\n\nAnd to answer your question:\n\nTraditionally (pre industrial revolution) kimonos were worn by people of different social class for a variety of occasions. Kimono actually means \"clothes\", which includes sub categories such as samui (work clothes) or yukata (summer clothes). There's also a word for western clothes (洋服), which is what most people wear these days.\n\nIn modern era, there are certain occasions you are more likely to see it (e.g. summer festivals, tea ceremony, black tie events), but it's not uncommon to see people wearing kimono on the streets any time of the year. \n\nMaybe it's worth having a conversation with your daughter-in-law to get her perspective on it.",

They surveyed the island, took biological records of the wildlife, and to an extent modernized Taiwan. I was surprised to see how a sizable portion of Taiwan’s natural history museum were contributions by Japanese scientists when I went to Taipei.\n\nHowever, I think it’s about how people in Taiwan perceive Japanese occupation which is relevant. This actually isn’t entirely about what Japan did in Taiwan, but what came after. The kuomintang led nationalist government committed mass murder (known as the 228 incident), which made those who lived through both eras look back fondly at the era of Japanese occupation.\n\nI’m not trying to justify colonialism, but feel that the atrocities by the nationalism government seems to have painted a (relatively) positive light of the Japanese occupation in the eyes of the elders. \n\nI am curious to hear a Taiwanese persons’ perspective on this though, because my understanding is that the occupying japanese forces also did their fair share of inhumane acts during the occupation.",

Just personal opinions, take them or leave them.\n\n  \n**Do away with glasses -** \n\nHave you considered contacts? If not you should look into it. Or lasik although that's a bit pricy (and scary to some). I did it and was the best decision ever.\n\n  \n**Work out -** \n\nmake sure to get enough protein and look into creatine as well\n\nI'd recommend losing weight though cardio &amp; eating healthier, as well as build muscle though bench and squats. Don't forget to stretch too since you can injure yourself! And get a gym rat to spot you. Once you start losing weight you'll see your face slim down as well\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BQ3QVQJ9/ref=ppx\\_yo\\_dt\\_b\\_search\\_asin\\_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BQ3QVQJ9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ULZF5HC/ref=ppx\\_yo\\_dt\\_b\\_search\\_asin\\_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ULZF5HC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n\n  \n**Fashion -** \n\nUniqlo is a good start, but you gotta dress well in Uniqlo\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/steelojeem/reel/C\\_oENHCPkft](https://www.instagram.com/steelojeem/reel/C_oENHCPkft)\n\n(If you're in Japan just buy them there it's cheaper haha)\n\nI wouldn't recommend you wearing anime related items if you're trying to be \"conventionally attractive\". Make it something very subtle, like a tiny totoro tattoo on your wrist, or a ring which doesn't shout ANIMEEEEE! Also if someone asks your about it you can elaborate on your interest, but keep it short and succinct so you don't nerd out until you know they are interested in learning more.\n\nIf you can afford it, go one layer above and try Cos\n\n[https://www.cos.com/en\\_usd/men.html](https://www.cos.com/en_usd/men.html)\n\n\n\n**Eyebrows** **-** \n\nGo get your brows done at an Indian threading place.

I found linksDAO to be an interesting concept of fractionally owning a golf course, and they're still active but not much hype around them anymore either. Most major brand NFT collaborations have died down as well  \n\\- the NFT craze has not settled into something sustainable, it's dead. Can it come back? Possibly, it has happened before, when cryptopunks and cryptokitties were first hot in 2017-ish, then died, then came back during 2020-2022.  \n\\- will there be a big boom? I personally don't think it would in the way we think of NFTs as collectables. A major thesis was around digital scarcity, and that seemed possible during covid, but post covid people went back to f2f interactions. Digital scarcity could become a hot topic again if we see a broader adoption of VR or even XR, but that seems a bit down the line. I think fractional ownership of assets could be interesting, but they'd just be fungible tokens, not NFT\n\nI see so many one-off posts on this community with only a couple responses. Can't believe there's 2.7M members here. That alone should tell you that NFTs are no longer something people are interested in. I'd love to be proven wrong, since I feel that there was alot of potential, but so far it seems like the community is dead",

Today when I went to the bar and all of a sudden I felt like I was at a college basement party. I thought that I must have been hallucinating, but Then a girl pointed at me and referred to me as the old person. That's when I knew I had to get out of there.\n I was at the wrong party. \n\nAs I walk back home, all of a sudden I realize that there were now tens of thousands of 18 year-old 19 year-old 20-year-olds who were all living on top of each other and were super young and horny to basically use the New York nightlife as their own personal orgy dome.\n Naturally I felt violated\n\nBut then again, I thought to myself. Am I not the same as they are, just at a longer time horizon? I'm also a transient being in the city. They might only be here for three months, but I've only been here for three years as well. As a matter fact, there are bunch of people have done this for generations where their parents and their grandparents and their grandparents all met in New York, and they all decided to live somewhere in the broader region whether it be Westchester, Wilmington, Big Indian, Boston, etc. \nNew York City is equally adventurous to each, so who am I to judge how others enjoy this adventurous city.",
