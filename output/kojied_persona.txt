MBTI Traits:
  - Feeling
    Evidence: "Have had the plan for a month now, thought it could be spider mites but I don't see any webs on this one"
  - Judging
    Evidence: "I've been lurking in this channel for a while now, and have been greatly inspired by the ways people have found ways to stretch their money. This got me thinking, is there a way to develop a mental model on what we buy or don't buy?

I feel that most people decide what to buy based on past experiences, gut feeling, or the mood of that day. But is there a way to better understand what we get our "gratification" from, and track this?

My initial idea was an app that would enable users to track the "gratification" they receive from their purchases. If you regret what you bought, you can record a decline in the gratification, or if you found the purchase better than you expected, you can record an increase.

Of course, this would not necessarily apply to all purchases. Some things (rent, insurance, etc.) do not yield any gratification scores, but many purchases (clothes, going out, etc.) could.

&amp;#x200B;

Would love to hear how you make your purchase decisions, and if there's a mental model you follow!

Motivational Drivers:
  - Speed
    Evidence: "Depends on your definition of "quick", but you can crack into Private Equity you'd likely have \~5M in net worth by the time you're 40. 

Key to "rich" is to have assets which appreciate in value, but also have sufficient income to pay for your daily expenses. PE will give you both.

There's a reason why it's such a highly coveted career in the white collar space.

The most straight forward way to get there is to get into a target school, maintain high GPA, get into a good IB program, then recruit for PE.

Is it competitive? Yes. Is it going to be long hours and hard work? Yes. But it'll set you and your future generation for financial independence. Being from a wealthy family who can donate their way into an ivy league school or have family friends who are GPs would make it much much much easier, but you can make it happen with hard work and dedication.

  
(Of course, similar to the tech meltdown, it's unclear if this model will be viable a decade or two in the future. But if the rich are going to get richer, it will continue to happen through PE, and you'll get a piece of that pie being at the table)"

Consumer Archetypes:
  - Early Adopter
    Evidence: "Looking forwards to hearing how long the new one will last. I feel that the quality has gone down in the recent years, so fingers crossed it'll last for another 20"
  - Minimalist
    Evidence: "Thank you!
Yes, I wouldn’t consider what I did gambling. For me, it was quite foreseeable that COVID-19 was going to make a global impact, especially if you knew people in China or Japan."
  - Creator
    Evidence: "Now that’s some exciting stuff! Spacial workflow. The question is: does this make it worth wearing a AVP on your head? Probably not yet, but maybe down the line?"
  - Analyst
    Evidence: "I don't really understand the use case for this. I feel like the ipad is sufficient, or you can just use the AVP to do the same research?"

Reddit Usage Habits:
  - {'active_hours': '0:00 - 23:00 UTC', 'top_subreddits': [('VisionPro', 70), ('Frugal', 34), ('AskReddit', 16)]}
    Evidence: "Based on post timestamps and subreddits."

Expressions of Frustration:
  - Yes
    Evidence: "It’s racist too, stop fetishizing our culture, both in terms of Japanese culture as well as BM culture. Pretty annoying that it keeps on popping up even through I reported it as inappropriate"
